										<h2>Background</h2>
										<p>Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process.</p>

										<p>Through reliable, low-risk releases, Continuous Delivery makes it possible to continuously adapt
                                            software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market and changes to business strategy.
                                            Test, support, development and operations work together as one delivery team to automate and
                                            streamline the build, test and release process.</p>

										<p>During the seminar we will first introduce the aspects of continuous delivery,
                                            including continuous testing, integration and deployment. Then we will present
                                            the continuous inspections tools with a set of approaches to continuously assess
                                            the product quality, with the goal of preserving the software maintainability while releasing new features.</p>

                                        <p>The workshop is aimed at demonstrating and disseminating the power of DevOps in the cloud,
                                            for the purpose of increasing software maintainability and improve the development process quality. </p>

                                        <p>During the seminar we will will provide to software practitioners information on how to start using DevOps
                                            and how the University of Bolzano can support them in the process of adopting DevOps.</p>

                                                                Many companies are still hesitant to migrate because they consider microservice as a hype or because they are not aware of the migration process and the benefits and issues related to migration.
                                                                In this talk, I will introduce microservices and the main migration processes adopted by practitioners, together with the common motivations and issues that commonly take place during migrations.

                                                                We created a product as a service to enable our customers
                                                                to create and send digital invoices to the public administration,

                                                                Our solution turned out to be  a big monolith that was hard do maintain
                                                                and hard to evolve. For this reason we decide to split our monolith in smaller pieces.
